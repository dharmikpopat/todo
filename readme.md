# TO-DO List

- A user can sign up and sign in to the platform.
- The signed in user can be able to create, edit, view, complete and delete the todo list.
- The app should be integrated to a another app and make sure the app will provide some API Auth and API functionality.
- Migrations (created appropriate migrations).
- Events (an event class should be created and the event should be logged, when ever CRUD happens).
